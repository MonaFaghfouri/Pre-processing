# üßπ Pre-processing for Farsi Texts
This repository provides a collection of text preprocessing notebooks specifically designed for Persian (Farsi) language content ‚Äî such as tweets, articles, and user-generated texts. These scripts help you clean, normalize, and tokenize raw text data for further NLP analysis or modeling tasks.
